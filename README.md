## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TailWind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- With a Bbit of Javascript on the hamburger menu dropdown

### What I learned

Honestly, it was a lot of work, I almost wanted to give up but fortunately I did not. At a point, I enjoyed completing this project. I learnt a lot of patience and consistency in the challenge. It was my first time doing a project with Tailwind CSS. To be honest I find it really interesting. The simplification of CSS components makes it easier to understand. And how it makes it easier to create a mobile first website is what I am thankful for, it eases the stress of media query.

### Continued development

I want to keep developing on CSS especially with Tailwind. Also, I need to do better with media query.

### Useful resources

- Tailwind CSS
- Brad Traversy course was a big help.
